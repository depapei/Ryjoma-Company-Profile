                As an Information Systems student at Bina Nusantara University, I have a deep interest in data and business processes, particularly in the field of analysis. My academic journey has equipped me with strong technical skills, including proficiency in SQL for Database Design, Visual Studio for Data Warehouse Design, and various data visualization tools such as Microsoft Excel and Tableau, enabling me to transform complex datasets into actionable insights. <br><br>
                Beyond technical expertise, my involvement in campus organizations, especially as a member of the Information Systems student association, has enhanced my soft skills and organizational experience. This contributes to a well-rounded skill set, preparing me to navigate the dynamic landscape of information technology. <br><br>
                Driven by curiosity and dedication to data and business processes, I aspire to leverage my skills and passion to make meaningful contributions in these fields.
